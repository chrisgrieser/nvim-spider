1. nvim-spider                                           *spider-nvim-spider-*

Usethe `w`, `e`, `b` motions like a spider. Move by subwords and skip
insignificant punctuation.

Lua implementation of CamelCaseMotion, with extra consideration of punctuation.
Works in normal, visual, and operator-pending mode. Supports counts and
dot-repeat.

FEATURES                                        *spider-nvim-spider--features*

The `w`, `e`, `b` (and `ge`) motions work the same as the default ones by vim,
except for two differences:


SUBWORD MOTION ~

The movements happen by subwords, meaning it stops at the sub-parts of a
camelCase, SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE, or kebab-case variable.

>lua
    -- positions vim's `w` will move to
    local myVariableName = FOO_BAR_BAZ
    --    ^              ^ ^
    
    -- positions spider's `w` will move to
    local myVariableName = FOO_BAR_BAZ
    --    ^ ^       ^    ^ ^   ^   ^
<


SKIPPING INSIGNIFICANT PUNCTUATION ~

A sequence of one or more punctuation characters is considered significant if
it is surrounded by whitespace and does not include any non-punctuation
characters.

>lua
    foo == bar .. "baz"
    --  ^      ^    significant punctuation
    
    foo:find("a")
    -- ^    ^  ^  insignificant punctuation
<

This speeds up the movement across the line by reducing the number of mostly
unnecessary stops.

>lua
    -- positions vim's `w` will move to
    if foo:find("%d") and foo == bar then print("[foo] has" .. bar) end
    -- ^  ^^   ^  ^^  ^   ^   ^  ^   ^    ^    ^  ^  ^ ^  ^ ^  ^  ^ ^  -> 21
    
    -- positions spider's `w` will move to
    if foo:find("%d") and foo == bar then print("[foo] has" .. bar) end
    -- ^   ^      ^   ^   ^   ^  ^   ^    ^       ^    ^    ^  ^    ^  -> 14
<

If you prefer to use this plugin only for subword motion, you can disable this
feature by setting `skipInsignificantPunctuation = false` in the `.setup()`
call.


  **Note** This plugin ignores vim’s `iskeyword` option.

INSTALLATION                                *spider-nvim-spider--installation*

>lua
    -- packer
    use { "chrisgrieser/nvim-spider" }
    
    -- lazy.nvim
    { "chrisgrieser/nvim-spider", lazy = true },
<

No keybindings are created by default. Below are the mappings to replace the
default `w`, `e`, and `b` motions with this plugin’s version of them.

>lua
    vim.keymap.set({"n", "o", "x"}, "w", "<cmd>lua require('spider').motion('w')<CR>", { desc = "Spider-w" })
    vim.keymap.set({"n", "o", "x"}, "e", "<cmd>lua require('spider').motion('e')<CR>", { desc = "Spider-e" })
    vim.keymap.set({"n", "o", "x"}, "b", "<cmd>lua require('spider').motion('b')<CR>", { desc = "Spider-b" })
    vim.keymap.set({"n", "o", "x"}, "ge", "<cmd>lua require('spider').motion('ge')<CR>", { desc = "Spider-ge" })
<


  **Note** For dot-repeat to work, you have to call the motions as Ex-commands.
  When calling `function() require("spider").motion("w") end` as third argument
  of the keymap, dot-repeatability will _not_ work.

CONFIGURATION                              *spider-nvim-spider--configuration*

The `.setup()` call is optional. Currently, its only option is to disable the
skipping of insignificant punctuation:

>lua
    -- default value
    require("spider").setup({
        skipInsignificantPunctuation = true
    })
<

You can also pass this configuration table to the `motion` function:

>lua
    require('spider').motion('w', { skipInsignificantPunctuation = false })
<

Any options passed here will be used, and any options not passed will use the
default configuration (from `setup()` or the default configuration)


NOTES ON OPERATOR-PENDING MODE*spider-nvim-spider--notes-on-operator-pending-mode*

In operator pending mode, vim’s `web` motions are actually a bit
inconsistent. For instance, `cw` will change to the _end_ of a word instead of
the start of the next word, like `dw` does. This is probably done for
convenience in vi’s early days before there were text objects. In my view,
this is quite problematic since it makes people habitualize inconsistent motion
behavior.

In this plugin, such small inconsistencies are therefore deliberately not
implemented. Apart from the inconsistency, such a behavior can create
unexpected results when used in subwords or near punctuation. If you absolutely
want to, you can map `cw` to `ce` though. (Remember to add `remap = true` as
option for the keymap.)


SUBWORD TEXT OBJECT                  *spider-nvim-spider--subword-text-object*

This plugins supports `w`, `e`, and `b` in operater-pending mode, but does not
include a subword-variant of `iw`. For a version of `iw` that considers
camelCase, check out the `subword` text object of nvim-various-textobjs
<https://github.com/chrisgrieser/nvim-various-textobjs>.

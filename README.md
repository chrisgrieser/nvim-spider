Use the `w`, `e`, `b` motions like a spider. Move by subwords and skip
insignificant punctuation.

A lua implementation of
[CamelCaseMotion](https://github.com/bkad/CamelCaseMotion), with extra
consideration of punctuation. Works in normal, visual, and operator-pending
mode. Supports counts and dot-repeat.

## Features
The `w`, `e`, `b` (and `ge`) motions work the same as the default ones by vim,
except for two differences:

### Subword Motion
The movements happen by subwords, meaning it stops at the sub-parts of a
camelCase, SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE, or kebab-case variable.

```lua
-- positions vim's `w` will move to
local myVariableName = FOO_BAR_BAZ
--    ^              ^ ^

-- positions spider's `w` will move to
local myVariableName = FOO_BAR_BAZ
--    ^ ^       ^    ^ ^   ^   ^
```

### Skipping Insignificant Punctuation
A sequence of one or more punctuation characters is considered significant if it
is surrounded by whitespace and does not include any non-punctuation characters.

```lua
foo == bar .. "baz"
--  ^      ^    significant punctuation

foo:find("a")
-- ^    ^  ^  insignificant punctuation
```

This speeds up the movement across the line by reducing the number of mostly
unnecessary stops.

```lua
-- positions vim's `w` will move to
if foo:find("%d") and foo == bar then print("[foo] has" .. bar) end
-- ^  ^^   ^  ^^  ^   ^   ^  ^   ^    ^    ^  ^  ^ ^  ^ ^  ^  ^ ^  -> 21

-- positions spider's `w` will move to
if foo:find("%d") and foo == bar then print("[foo] has" .. bar) end
-- ^   ^      ^   ^   ^   ^  ^   ^    ^       ^    ^    ^  ^    ^  -> 14
```

If you prefer to use this plugin only for subword motions, you can disable this
feature by setting `skipInsignificantPunctuation = false` in the `.setup()`
call.

> [!NOTE]
> This plugin ignores vim's `iskeyword` option.

## Installation

```lua
-- packer
use { "chrisgrieser/nvim-spider" }

-- lazy.nvim
{
	"chrisgrieser/nvim-spider",
	keys = {
		{ -- example for lazy-loading on keystroke
			"e",
			"<cmd>lua require('spider').motion('e')<CR>",
			mode = { "n", "o", "x" },
		},
	},
},
```

No keybindings are created by default. Below are the mappings to replace the
default `w`, `e`, and `b` motions with this plugin's version of them.

```lua
vim.keymap.set(
	{ "n", "o", "x" },
	"w",
	"<cmd>lua require('spider').motion('w')<CR>",
	{ desc = "Spider-w" }
)
vim.keymap.set(
	{ "n", "o", "x" },
	"e",
	"<cmd>lua require('spider').motion('e')<CR>",
	{ desc = "Spider-e" }
)
vim.keymap.set(
	{ "n", "o", "x" },
	"b",
	"<cmd>lua require('spider').motion('b')<CR>",
	{ desc = "Spider-b" }
)
```
<!-- vale Google.Will = NO -->
> [!NOTE]
> For dot-repeat to work, you have to call the motions as Ex-commands. When
> calling `function() require("spider").motion("w") end` as third argument of
> the keymap, dot-repeatability will *not* work.

## Configuration
The `.setup()` call is optional.

```lua
-- default values
require("spider").setup {
	skipInsignificantPunctuation = true,
	subwordMovement = true,
	customPatterns = {}, -- overrides other settings if not-empty. See README.
}
```

You can also pass this configuration table to the `motion` function:

```lua
require("spider").motion("w", { skipInsignificantPunctuation = false })
```

Any options passed here will be used, and override the options set in the
`setup()` call.

### Advanced: Custom Movement Patterns
You can use the `customPatterns` table to define custom movement patterns. These
must be [lua patterns](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.4/manual.html#6.4.1), and
they must be symmetrical (work the same backwards and forwards) to also work
correctly with `b` and `ge`. If multiple patterns are listed, the motion
searches for all of them and stops at the closest one. When there is no match, the
search continues in the next line, allowing for movements similar to a search.

If you have interesting ideas for custom patterns, please share them in the
[GitHub discussions](./discussions).

A few examples:

```lua
-- The motion stops at the beginning of the next number.
require("spider").motion("w", {
	customPatterns = { "%d+" },
})

-- The motion stops only at hashes like `ef82a2`. (There is not quantifier like
-- `{5,}` in lua patterns, making the repetition necessary.)
require("spider").motion("w", {
	customPatterns = { "[a-f0-9][a-f0-9][a-f0-9][a-f0-9][a-f0-9]+" },
})

-- The motion stops at the next declaration of a variable in -- javascript.
-- (The `e` motion combined with the `.` matching any character in
-- lua ensures that you stop at beginning of the variable name.)
require("spider").motion("e", {
	customPatterns = { "const .", "let ." },
})
```

> [!NOTE]
> Setting the option overrides `nvim-spider`'s default behavior, meaning subword
> movement and skipping of punctuation are disabled. You can add
> `customPatterns` as an option to the `.motion` call to create extra motions,
> while still having access `nvim-spider`'s default behavior.

## Subword Text Object
This plugin supports `w`, `e`, and `b` in operator-pending mode, but does not
include a subword variant of `iw`. For a version of `iw` that considers
camelCase, check out the `subword` text object of
[nvim-various-textobjs](https://github.com/chrisgrieser/nvim-various-textobjs).

<!-- vale Google.FirstPerson = NO -->
## Notes on Operator-pending Mode
In operator pending mode, vim's `web` motions are actually a bit inconsistent.
For instance, `cw` will change to the *end* of a word instead of the start of
the next word, like `dw` does. This is probably done for convenience in vi's
early days before there were text objects. In my view, this is quite problematic
since it makes people habitualize inconsistent motion behavior.

In this plugin, such small inconsistencies are therefore deliberately not
implemented. Apart from the inconsistency, such a behavior can create unexpected
results when used in subwords or near punctuation. If you absolutely want to,
you can map `cw` to `ce` though. (Remember to add `remap = true` as option for
the keymap.)
